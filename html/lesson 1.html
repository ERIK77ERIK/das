<h1>What is <i>lorem ipsum</i>?</h1>
<b>lorem ipsum</b>Lorem Ipsum is simply <del>dummy</del> text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
 make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
 the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
 unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
 of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
 passages, and more recently 
 with desktop publishing software like 
 Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
